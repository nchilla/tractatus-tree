# Another Tractatus Tree

Using the JSON version of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus scraped by [Pierre Bellon](https://pbellon.github.io/#!/en) from [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130728040810/http://people.umass.edu/phil335-klement-2/tlp/tlp.html) to visualize the book.

You can see my first version, a virtually unformatted DOM-dump, [here](https://nchilla.github.io/tractatus-tree/dom)

## To change:

* Change preface from Ogden version to Pears/McGuinness to match the rest
* Fix image filepaths
