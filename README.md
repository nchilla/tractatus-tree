# Another Tractatus Tree

## Iteration directory:

["dom dump"](https://nchilla.github.io/tractatus-tree/dom)

[tabs](https://nchilla.github.io/tractatus-tree/tabs)


## The idea
Reading through the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus by Ludwig Wittgenstein in print, I was puzzled by the lack of visual hierarchy for the branches of propositions.

This is how it looks:
![How the Tractatus appears in my printed edition](assets/tractatus-print.png)

The issue is the sub-propositions go up to 5 layers in from the first parent (e.g. 2.0.1.2.3.1). That's very difficult to elegantly format in a way that makes sense and is informative.

I have two objectives:

* **In print** I want to take on the task of typesetting the Tractatus such that the hierarchy is present and informative.

* **On the web** I want to experiment with both informative and experimental digital formats to map/present propositions.

## Development status:


This is forked from [Pierre Bellon's](https://pbellon.github.io/#!/en) D3 hierarchy visualization of the Tractatus; I gutted the repo and kept the JSON he scraped from [here](https://people.umass.edu/klement/tlp/tlp.html), which I'll use for each visualization I make.

You can see my first test, an indented DOM-dump, [here](https://nchilla.github.io/tractatus-tree/dom)


### In Progress/to-do:
* For "tabs" iteration:
  * tab markers
  * mobile view
  * better indicator for when a prop has children, maybe with a counter
  * way to search for props, and URL queries
* Find sections missing from the scrape and add them to the JSON. So far I've noticed problems with:
  * missing content:
    * 5.101
  * redraw graphic:
    * 6.36111
  * wrap full expression:
    * 6, 5.5301, 5.525, 5.5301, 5.5351, 5.5352


## Wall Spaghetti:

Here are my ideas so far. See [predecessors](#user-content-ways-other-people-have-tried-this) for context.

* **A collapsible version** like [this](http://daxoliver.com/tractatus/) but with better typesetting and interactive features.
  * When only the main 1-7 propositions are open, the scale of the type goes up to fill the screen.
  * Could be understood as an accordion "nav menu" but not necessarily made to look that way graphically

* **A "draggable" canvas tree map** such as what both Juliette and Alex suggested for my idea last week.

* **A line hierarchy structure** similar to Tumblr/Reddit's form of organizing comment threads.
  * I imagine this may work well for print because it's highly compact.

* A version **visualization of the number of words/characters/sub-propositions** in props 1-7 through their scale/proportion.
  * I'm thinking of concentric circle groupings, like the ones people make in Prezi.

* **Interactive graphics** for specific propositions or sets of propositions, possibly utilizing the graphics in the book.


## Typography

I want to keep my type choices consistent across all the viewing/reading formats I design. For that I'll need to settle on three styles:

* **The body text**; I want a serif that feels contemporary, highly legible, and not full of itself; I also want to reflect the logical dogma and philosophy of mathematics in this approach to language.
  * I am thinking of using [Signifier](https://klim.co.nz/blog/signifier-design-information/): "Signifier emerged from this alchemy with BÃ©zier curves and sharp vectors determined by machine logic and a Brutalist ethos"

* **The mathematical figures** in some propositions will like use [Aktiv Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk) because of its glorious math support.

* **The "keys"** for each proposition, which I think will also be in Aktiv.

## Ways other people have tried this

I'm not the first person to have this idea! I've tracked down a collection of researchers who have tried to come up with innovative digital formats to read or visualize the Tractatus. Here are a few examples:
