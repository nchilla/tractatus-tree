## The idea
Reading through the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus by Ludwig Wittgenstein in print, I was puzzled by the lack of visual hierarchy for the branches of propositions.

This is how it looks:
![How the Tractatus appears in my printed edition](assets/tractatus-print.png)

The issue is the sub-propositions go up to 5 layers in from the first parent (e.g. 2.0.1.2.3.1). That's very difficult to elegantly format in a way that makes sense and is informative.

I have two objectives:

* **In print** I want to take on the task of typesetting the Tractatus such that the hierarchy is present and informative.

* **On the web** I want to experiment with both informative and experimental digital formats to map/present propositions.

## Development status:


This is forked from [Pierre Bellon's](https://pbellon.github.io/#!/en) D3 hierarchy visualization of the Tractatus; I gutted the repo and kept the JSON he scraped from [here](https://people.umass.edu/klement/tlp/tlp.html), which I'll use for each visualization I make.

You can see my first test, an indented DOM-dump, [here](https://nchilla.github.io/tractatus-tree/dom)


### In Progress/to-do:
For **Tabs** iteration:
- [X] tab markers
- [x] preface access
- [x] header bar
- [x] better indicator for when a prop has children
- [ ] mobile navigation
- [ ] way to search for props, and URL queries
- [ ] some information about the project and translation in header

For **Context Map** iteration:
- [X] A flexible width dendrogram showing you only the nodes and depths that are relevant to the context of the proposition you are reading
- [X] The map redraws itself according to which proposition is focused on screen, using Russell Goldenberg's [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama/)
- [ ] Interactivity for map
  - [ ] Clicking on a prop's circle should scroll you to its place in the text and redraw the map
  - [ ] when you hover over a prop, it will expand a horizontal menu showing its children
- [ ] mobile navigation
- [ ] some information about the project and translation in header


General:
- [ ] Find sections missing from the scrape and add them to the JSON. So far I've noticed problems with:
  * missing content:
    * 5.101
  * redraw graphic:
    * 6.36111
  * wrap full expression:
    * 6, 5.5301, 5.525, 5.5301, 5.5351, 5.5352


## Wall Spaghetti:

Here are my ideas so far. See [predecessors](#user-content-ways-other-people-have-tried-this) for context.

* A collapsible version like [this](http://daxoliver.com/tractatus/) but with better typesetting and interactive features.
  * When only the main 1-7 propositions are open, the scale of the type goes up to fill the screen.
  * Could be understood as an accordion "nav menu" but not necessarily made to look that way graphically

* A "draggable" canvas tree map such as what both Juliette and Alex suggested for my idea last week.

* A line hierarchy structure similar to Tumblr/Reddit's form of organizing comment threads.
  * I imagine this may work well for print because it's highly compact.

* A visualization of the number of words/characters/sub-propositions in props 1-7 through their scale/proportion.
  * I'm thinking of concentric circle groupings, like the ones people make in Prezi.

* Interactive graphics for specific propositions or sets of propositions, possibly utilizing the graphics in the book.

* A sidebar outline for navigation, using a similar visual logic to [this tree structure](http://tractatus.lib.uiowa.edu/map/)
  * it could respond and potentially animate as the page scrolls

* Something using progress bars


## Typography

I want to keep my type choices consistent across all the viewing/reading formats I design. For that I'll need to settle on three styles:

* **The body text**; I want a serif that feels contemporary, highly legible, and not full of itself; I also want to reflect the logical dogma and philosophy of mathematics in this approach to language.
  * I am thinking of using [Signifier](https://klim.co.nz/blog/signifier-design-information/): "Signifier emerged from this alchemy with BÃ©zier curves and sharp vectors determined by machine logic and a Brutalist ethos"

* **The mathematical figures** in some propositions will like use [Aktiv Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk) because of its glorious math support.

* **The "keys"** for each proposition, which I think will also be in Aktiv.

## Ways other people have tried this

I'm not the first person to have this idea! I've tracked down a collection of researchers who have tried to come up with innovative digital formats to read or visualize the Tractatus. Here are a few examples:
